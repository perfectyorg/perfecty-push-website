  Perfecty Push Website
</h1>


## Quick start

1. **Install the Gatsby CLI.**

   ```shell
   npm install -g gatsby-cli
   ```

2. **Start the sites in `develop` mode.**

   Next, move into your site’s directory and start it up:

   ```sh
   cd perfecty-push-website/
   gatsby develop
   ```

3. **Open the first source code and start editing!**

   Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`. Open the `perfecty-push-website` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes, and the browser will update in real time!

At this point, you’ve got a fully functional Gatsby website. For additional information on how you can customize your Gatsby site, see our [plugins](https://gatsbyjs.org/plugins/) and [the official tutorial](https://gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).
